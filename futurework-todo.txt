Serge: je pense qu'il oppose SCC avec des approches que l'on appelle
behavior-based oÃ¹ grosso-modo on empile des couches de comportements
en // sur les capteurs et on mixe les sorties. c'est une remarque
interessante. mais je vois pas pourquoi diaspec ne pourrait pas faire
cela. c'est a creuser en effet.
