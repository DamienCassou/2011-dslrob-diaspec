\begin{abstract}

These instructions provide basic guidelines for preparing camera-ready (CR)
Proceedings-style papers. This document is itself an example of the
desired layout for CR papers (inclusive of this abstract). The document
contains information regarding desktop publishing format, type sizes, and
type faces. Style rules are provided that explain how to handle equations,
units, figures, tables, references, abbreviations, and acronyms. Sections
are also devoted to the preparation of the references and acknowledgments.
