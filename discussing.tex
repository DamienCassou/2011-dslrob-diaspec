A robotics application is mostly static and often contains only one
instance of each entity. This makes entity selection and subscription
mostly useless and they would better be done within the programming
framework.

Types can be reused from existing software frameworks, such as ROS.
This makes the whole application description and implementation
simpler. However, this also tightly couples the whole application to a
particular software framework, limiting reuse in other contexts.
