\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Several software engineering approaches have been proposed to lower
the complexity of robotics systems~\cite{Brug07a}. Among them we can cite:

\paragraph*{Middleware and Software Frameworks}

Numerous middleware and software frameworks have been proposed to
support the implementation of robotics applications (\eg{}
CLARATy~\cite{Claraty}, ROS~\cite{ROS} and
Player/Stage~\cite{Coll05a}). Such approaches attempt to cover as much
of the robotics domain as possible in a single programming framework.
This strategy often leads to large APIs, providing little guidance to
the developer and requiring boilerplate code to customize the
programming framework to the characteristics of the application. In
contrast, a \diaspec{}-generated programming framework specifically
targets one application, limiting the API to methods of interest to
the developers. Our code generator could potentially target these
middleware thus leveraging existing work and completely hiding their
intricacies from the developer.

\paragraph*{Component-Based and Model-Driven Software Engineering}

Component-Based Software Engineering for robotics~\cite{Brug07b} and
Model-Driven Engineering for Robotics (\eg{} OMG RTC~\cite{OMGRTC},
SmartSoft~\cite{Schl09a}) are approaches that apply and tailor
general-purpose and established principles of lowering complexity to
robotics needs and come up with domain-specific extensions.

\paragraph*{Domain-Specific Languages}

\emph{Smach} is a Python embedded DSL based on hierarchical concurrent
state machines for building complex robot behavior from primitive
ones~\cite{Boren10a}. \emph{Smach} is tightly coupled with ROS, allows
only static compositions of behavior and can not adapt compositions to
new situations during execution.

SmartTCL (Smart Task Coordination Language) is an extension of
Common Lisp that is used to do on line dynamic reconfiguration of the
software components involved in a robot~\cite{Stec11a}: knowledge
bases, simulation engines, symbolic task planners, models and
low-level hardware. At design time, the developer defines execution
variants that robot operates at runtime. In order to lower robotics
inherent complexity, analysis and simulation tools could also be used
at runtime to determine pending execution steps with specific
parametrisation before the robot effectively execute them.

Unlike these DSLs, \diaspec{} allows a natural decomposition of
applications according to the SCC architectural pattern, guiding the
work of the developer. Compared to SmartTCL \diaspec{} lacks the
ability to recompose the components at runtime.
