Several software engineering approaches have been proposed to lower
the complexity of robotics systems~\cite{Brug07a}.

Numerous middlewares and software frameworks have been proposed to
support the implementation of robotics applications (\eg{}
CLARATy~\cite{Claraty}, ROS~\cite{ROS} and Player~\cite{Coll05a}).
Such approaches attempt to cover as much of the robotics domain as
possible in a single programming framework. This strategy often leads
to large APIs, providing little guidance to the developer and
requiring boilerplate code to customize the programming framework to
the characteristics of the application. In contrast, a
\diaspec{}-generated programming framework specifically targets one
application, limiting the API to methods of interest to the
developers. Our code generator could potentially target these
middlewares thus leveraging existing work and completely hiding their
intricacies from the developer.


Component-based software engineering for robotics~\cite{Brug07b} and
model-driven software engineering for Robotics (e.g., OMG
RTC~\cite{OMGRTC}, SmartSoft~\cite{Schl09a}). All these approaches
apply and tailor general-purpose and established principles of
lowering complexity to robotics needs and come up with domain-specific
extensions.
