\section{Introduction}

A Sense/Compute/Control (SCC) application is one that interacts with
the physical environment~\cite{Tayl09a}. The SCC architectural pattern
guides the description of SCC applications and involves four kinds of
components, organized into layers~\cite{Cass11a,Edwar09a}: (1)
\emph{sensors} at the bottom, which obtain information about the
environment; (2) then \emph{context operators}, which process this
information; (3) then \emph{control operators}, which use this refined
information to control (4) \emph{actuators} at the top, which finally
impact the environment. A robotics application is a kind of SCC
application where the physical environment is composed of a robot
(engines, a knowledge base, a software, \etc{}) and the robot's
neighborhood (the walls, ground, people, \etc{})~\cite{Sicil08a}.

\diaspec{} is a design language dedicated to describing SCC
applications. From such a design description, the \diaspec{} compiler
produces a dedicated Java programming framework
(Figure~\ref{fig:diaspec-process}) that is both \emph{prescriptive}
and \emph{restrictive}: it is prescriptive in the sense that it guides
the developer, and it is restrictive in the sense that it limits the
developer to what the design description allows. For each component
description in the design, the compiler generates an abstract class.
The abstract methods in this class (\emph{holes} in the programming
framework represented in Figure~\ref{fig:diaspec-process}) represent
code to be provided by the developer, to allow him to program the
application logic (\textit{}). To implement a component, the developer
implements these methods in a subclass of this abstract class and thus
never modifies generated code.

By separating application logic (implemented by the developers) and
runtime support (generated in the programming framework), \diaspec{}
facilitates the design, implementation and evolution of SCC
applications. In the rest of this paper, we report on an experiment of
designing a standard robotics application in the SCC architectural
style with the \diaspec{} language and show how to implement such an
application on top of the generated programming framework.
